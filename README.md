# CodeTheChange
This readme belongs to Hackathon CodeTheChange 2021, we have implemented a telegram bot that gives you Mental Health Recommendations. This project is under construction at the moment.

The program will be ran through `__main__.py`. Make sure to do the following commands before running our files:

## Installing Pip and Dependecies
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py // Pip installation 

python get-pip.py

pip help // To check installation
```
Few dependecies will needed as well therefore run the following commands:
```
pip install python-decouple

```
In order to use this bot information inside `prodil.ini.sample` has to be filled and name of this file needs to be changed to `prodil.ini`.

After neccessary dependecies are connected, this bot can be executed order to run with `python -m prodil`
